    "text": "Measuring Power & Building Impacts Cohort\nContext: Peopleâ€™s Action Institute has been engaging in a long term project partnering with The Movement Cooperative and working through the PAI power building team to build definitions, metrics and best practices. Additionally, we are working to meet the moment around the need for CRM migrations as the current available tools become less viable for our organizations.\nGiven the viability of available tools, and their ability to meet our power building needs, this cohort is ideally about the work of cleaning data and preparing for migration from current systems/CRMS to ActionNetwork/ActionBuilder & fundraising platform of the institutionâ€™s choice.\nPurpose & Expectation: This is a working space that will function as a working group that will utilize a training of trainers format for many of the sessions, in order to prepare participants to bring the content and work back to their organization each month.\nThis cohort will only be as useful and successful as your ability to commit to the work in between sessions. These sessions will also build on each other, in order to be ready to move the process of migration it is necessary that cohort members commit to attending every session and that organizations have two participants, one data staff and an organizing director or lead organizer who can drive the process on power building culture and rigor.\nOrganizational Outcomes:\n\nOrganizations will have interrogated and evaluated their culture of data tracking and maintenance and the impact that culture and practice has on their power building.\nOrganizations will use this assessment to make shifts in culture and protocol for tracking power building.\nOrganizations will have worked a process to clean up current systems and data to prepare for migration, or to implement better practices in current database\nOrganizations will have the data, tools and organizational culture shifts in place to finalize migration and/or the ability to track power building impact more effectively in current systems at the end of this cohort",

If so, what is that tool, and why do you use it?\n\n\nDiscussion with organizers about tool usage:\n\nWe recommend this being a separate call so that the conversations are able to have the time they need for solid discussion.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat are your current practices around data entry and measuring power/leadership development? What is hard about tracking and measuring your base? How is the organizing culture of the organization set up to support this rigor? How might it not be?\nAre you tracking your base in your database or at least on paper? What metrics or data points are you tracking about leadership? Are you propositioning people in powerful ways? Are you doing many 1:1s? And are you tracking this data somewhere? Are you tracking too much or too little?\nWhat is your current user rate for your tool stack and culture of practice to use these tools?\n\nWhat currently does and does not work with your current tool stack?\nWhat is the level of usage of the tools for your base building/organizing?\nWhat is getting in the way?
