## Overview {.unnumbered}

Participants will review the leadership ladder workbook to identify common events, roles, matching criteria, thresholds, visualize results, and reflect on next questions to be taken back to their organization.
They will learn why maintaining data freshness matters more than collecting stale data and why not everything belongs in the CRM.
By the end, each team will prioritize 5–10 key metrics that align with their ladder of engagement.
