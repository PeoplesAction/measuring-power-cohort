* [Tech Stack Mapping](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGxWitsSiQ/z2GITCy5OGNM9rgG8GfzhQ/edit?utm_content=DAGxWitsSiQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton){.external target="_blank"}
* Survey of the tools:
  + Have your staff take a survey of all the tools that have been identified
  + Have them self identify the role that they use the tool from:
    - Organizers / Staff
    - Leaders
    - Managers
    - Admin
  + Then have people answer the following questions (for each tool):
    - On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being never heard of it, 10 being that you use it all the time; **How familiar are you with this tool?**
    - On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not useful at all, 10 being extremely useful; **How useful is this tool to your workflow?**
    - **Do you use an alternative tool instead of this tool for the purpose it provides? If so, what is that tool, and why do you use it?**
* Discussion with organizers about tool usage:
  + We recommend this being a separate call so that the conversations are able to have the time they need for solid discussion.
  + Questions:
    - **What are your current practices around data entry and measuring power/leadership development?** *What is hard about tracking and measuring your base? How is the organizing culture of the organization set up to support this rigor? How might it not be?*
    - **Are you tracking your base in your database or at least on paper? What metrics or data points are you tracking about leadership?** *Are you propositioning people in powerful ways? Are you doing many 1:1s? And are you tracking this data somewhere? Are you tracking too much or too little?*
    - **What is your current user rate for your tool stack and culture of practice to use these tools?**
      * *What currently does and does not work with your current tool stack?*
      * *What is the level of usage of the tools for your base building/organizing?*
      * *What is getting in the way? (time, training, accountability etc)*
